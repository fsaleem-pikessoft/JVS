# Why You're Not Receiving Emails - Complete Solution Guide

## 🔴 The Problem

FormSubmit.co (the service we're using) requires **email verification** before it will send emails. Until you verify, emails are blocked.

## ✅ Solution Options

### Option 1: Verify FormSubmit Email (Free, 2 minutes)

**Step 1:** Submit a test form from your contact page

**Step 2:** Check `heelofaizan222@gmail.com`:
- Open Gmail
- Sign in to `heelofaizan222@gmail.com`
- Check **Inbox**
- Check **Spam/Junk folder** (most important!)
- Search for "formsubmit" or "verify"

**Step 3:** Click the verification link in the email

**Step 4:** Done! All future emails will arrive automatically

## 🔍 Troubleshooting FormSubmit

### If verification email not received:

2. **Wait 10 minutes** - Sometimes delayed
3. **Submit form again** - Triggers new verification email
4. **Check email filters** - Make sure nothing is blocking FormSubmit
5. **Try different browser** - Sometimes helps

### After verification, if emails still not arriving:

1. Check spam folder for form submissions
